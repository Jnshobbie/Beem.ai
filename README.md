## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

**Beem** an AI-powered web application built was a final project for Harvard's CS50 course.  
Its primary purpose is to help non-technical users interact with an artificial intelligence system 
that assists them in generating code, answering questions, and facilitating productive conversations 
related to software development and AI. Inspired by tools like **ChatGPT** and **Lovable.dev**, Beem 
combines a conversational interface with advanced backend logic to help users technical or not, build 
what they envision using the art of programming. The app delivers an intuitive and easy-to-use experience, 
particularly for developers or learners who want to engage with AI in a structured, helpful environment.
Users can ask technical or conceptual questions, receive AI-generated code snippets, or simply use the 
interface as a productivity companion.

## âœ¨ Core Features

- **Chat Interface**: A sleek, responsive UI that works across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Dynamic Token Tracking**: Each user has a limited token balance; the app deducts tokens with each AI interaction and updates it in real time.
- **AI Integration**: Communicates with Google's Gemini model via an API to generate AI responses.
- **Persistent Conversations**: Conversations are saved by workspace using Convex, enabling users to return to past sessions.
- **Chat History**: Users can browse and reuse their previous AI chats and saved projects.
- **User Authentication**: Each user has a profile with avatar and token limits.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Visual loaders indicate when the AI is generating a response.

## File & Folder Structure

### `/pages/api/ai-chat.js`
Handles API route for submitting prompts to the AI (Google's Gemini) and returning the response. Acts as the brain of the AI logic.

### `/components/ChatView.jsx`
Main React component for the chat UI. Displays all messages, manages input, triggers token deductions, and shows AI/user chat bubbles.

### `/context/UserDetailContext.jsx`
Manages global user-specific data like token balance and avatar. Used across multiple components.

### `/context/MessagesContext.jsx`
Manages the state for all chat messages in a session/workspace, ensuring clean data flow and reactivity.

### `/data/Colors.jsx`
Holds all color constants to maintain UI consistency and theme flexibility.

### `/data/Prompt.jsx`
Contains default prompts that are prepended to user input to structure the AI's replies.

### `/convex/schema.js`
Handles database logic using Convex functions for updating messages, token usage, and user data persistence.

### `/public/`
Stores static assets like avatars, logos, and placeholder images.

---

## Design Decisions

### 1. **React + Context API**
React was used for modular UI development, and Context API was chosen to manage state globally without excessive prop-drilling.

### 2. **Convex for Backend**
Convex was used for its real-time querying and functional approach to backend logic. It's lightweight, scalable, and affordableâ€”ideal for this project's MVP scope.

### 3. **Tailwind CSS**
A utility-first framework like Tailwind CSS enabled fast, responsive UI development with minimal overhead and custom class naming.

### 4. **Robust AI Response Handling**
AI responses were parsed to detect valid JSON structures or fallback to raw text, improving reliability and flexibility in how answers are presented.

### 5. **Token Limiting System**
To simulate real-world limitations (like API quotas), each user has a token budget. Tokens are subtracted based on the length of AI responses, promoting thoughtful usage.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Multi-AI Model Support**: Let users switch between different AI models based on their needs and preferences.
- **Multi-Language & Framework Support**: Currently limited to React; support for other languages/frameworks will enhance flexibility.
- **Custom Avatars**: Allow users to upload or generate their own visual identity.
- **Voice Input**: Add voice-to-text functionality for hands-free AI interactions.
- **App Store Availability**: Plan to launch as a native app to make Beem available beyond the web.

## How to Run This Project Locally

### Prerequies

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v18.0.0 or higher)
- **npm** (v8.0.0 or higher) or **yarn** (v1.22.0 or higher)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd beem.ai
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Or using yarn
yarn install
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Create the environment file
touch .env.local
```

Add the following environment variables to `.env.local`:

```env
# Convex Database (Required)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your_convex_deployment_url

# Google OAuth (Required)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID_KEY=your_google_oauth_client_id

# Google Gemini AI (Required)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

### Step 4: Get Your API Keys

#### 1. Convex Database Setup
1. Go to [convex.dev](https://convex.dev)
2. Create a new account or sign in
3. Create a new project
4. Copy your deployment URL (looks like: `https://your-project.convex.cloud`)

#### 2. Google OAuth Setup
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the Google+ API
4. Go to "Credentials" â†’ "Create Credentials" â†’ "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
5. Set application type to "Web application"
6. Add authorized origins: `http://localhost:3000`
7. Add authorized redirect URIs: `http://localhost:3000`
8. Copy the Client ID

#### 3. Google Gemini AI Setup
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the API key

### Step 5: Run the Development Server

```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

# Or using yarn
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

### Step 6: Build for Production

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm start
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

1. **"Module not found" errors**
   ```bash
   # Clear node_modules and reinstall
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment variables not loading**
   - Ensure `.env.local` is in the root directory
   - Restart the development server after adding environment variables
   - Check that variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)

3. **Google OAuth not working**
   - Verify your Client ID is correct
   - Check that `http://localhost:3000` is in authorized origins
   - Ensure the Google+ API is enabled

4. **Convex connection issues**
   - Verify your Convex URL is correct
   - Check that your Convex project is active
   - Ensure you're using the correct deployment URL

5. **Gemini AI errors**
   - Verify your API key is correct
   - Check your API quota and billing status
   - Ensure the API key has the necessary permissions
